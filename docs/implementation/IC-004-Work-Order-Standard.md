IC-004 — Work Order Standard

Canonical Designation: IC-004

Title: Work Order Standard

Status: Canonical

Authority: This document establishes the required format, lifecycle, and execution rules for every Aureus Work Order. It is subordinate to the OAS Series, the Product Constitution, the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and the Implementation Constitution (IC-001).

---

Article I — Purpose

A Work Order is the exclusive mechanism by which implementation work is authorized.

No implementation shall begin without an approved Work Order unless explicitly authorized by a higher governing authority.

---

Article II — Required Structure

Every Work Order shall contain, at minimum:

- Work Order Number
- Title
- Status
- Priority
- Objective
- Scope
- Out of Scope
- Dependencies
- Source Documents
- Deliverables
- Files to Create
- Files to Modify
- Database Changes (if applicable)
- API Changes (if applicable)
- User Interface Changes (if applicable)
- Security Requirements
- Testing Requirements
- Acceptance Criteria
- Definition of Done

---

Article III — Scope Discipline

A Work Order authorizes only the work expressly described within it.

Implementation shall not:

- Expand scope.
- Add undocumented features.
- Remove approved functionality.
- Modify unrelated modules.
- Introduce architectural changes unless specifically authorized.

If additional work is discovered, it shall become a new Work Order.

---

Article IV — Dependencies

Before implementation begins, all required prerequisite Work Orders shall be completed unless the Work Order explicitly permits parallel execution.

Dependencies shall be verified before coding begins.

---

Article V — Implementation Process

Each Work Order shall follow this sequence:

1. Review governing documents.
2. Verify prerequisites.
3. Verify dependencies.
4. Implement approved scope.
5. Execute required testing.
6. Update documentation.
7. Verify acceptance criteria.
8. Produce completion report.

---

Article VI — Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria shall be:

- Objective
- Testable
- Measurable
- Complete
- Independent of interpretation

A Work Order shall not be considered complete until every acceptance criterion has been satisfied.

---

Article VII — Definition of Done

A Work Order is complete only when:

- Approved scope has been fully implemented.
- Required tests pass.
- Documentation is updated.
- Security requirements are satisfied.
- Acceptance criteria are met.
- Architectural compliance is maintained.
- Production readiness has been achieved unless otherwise specified.

---

Article VIII — Completion Report

Upon completion, the implementation agent shall provide:

- Summary of work completed
- Files created
- Files modified
- Tests executed
- Acceptance criteria status
- Known limitations
- Recommended next Work Order

---

Article IX — Traceability

Every implementation shall be traceable to its originating Work Order.

Documentation, code, tests, and related artifacts shall reference the applicable Work Order whenever practical.

---

Article X — Continuous Integrity

The Work Order system exists to ensure disciplined, auditable, and repeatable implementation.

No contributor, whether human or AI, may bypass the Work Order process except where expressly authorized by higher governing authority.
